Homework 1
This assignment will be due on May 25th 23:59 PT.

Write a C program that creates an array based on users’  input value and then prints out the elements of the array in reverse order.

The program should prompt the user to enter the size of the array, denoted as n. It should then create an array of size n and ask the user to input n integer values, one at a time, to fill the array.

After filling the array, the program should print the elements of the array in reverse order, starting from the last element and going backwards until the first element.

Make sure to use appropriate variable names and provide clear instructions and prompts, print its elements in reverse order.

Example output:

Enter the size of the array: 3
Input the value: 
1
Input the value: 
2
Input the value: 
3
Elements of the array in reverse order:
[3 2 1]

Don’t forget to attach the output screenshots in README.md.
